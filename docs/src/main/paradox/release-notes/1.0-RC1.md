# Alpakka 1.0-RC1

## First release candidate of Alpakka 1.0

By now all modules have been worked with to follow a similar structure so that both the user experience and the contributor experience are transferable across the many modules in Alpakka. The recommended structure for connectors is illustrated by the [Reference connector](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/reference.html).

With this release candidate Alpakka reaches the end of the [Road to Alpakka 1.0](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/08/30/alpakka-towards-1.0). We from now now we'll keep API changes to major releases, and keep minor releases [binary-compatible](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html#binary-compatibility-rules).

Having that said, a few parts make use of the `@ApiMayChange` annotation to keep the door open for API changes, so that they can evolve more rapidly than other modules within Alpakka.

If you have kept to older versions of Alpakka to avoid multiple upgrades, **now is the time** to start migrating to what it offers with 1.0.

Most artifacts of Alpakka are available for Scala 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13.0-M5.
