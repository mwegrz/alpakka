# Azure IoT Hub

IoTHub React is an Akka Stream library that can be used **to read events** from
[Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/), via a **reactive stream** with
**asynchronous back pressure**, and **to send commands** to connected devices.
Azure IoT Hub is a service used to connect thousands to millions of devices to the Azure cloud.

The library can be used both in Java and Scala, providing a fluent DSL for both programming
languages, similarly to the approach used by Akka.


## External library

This library is not maintained in the Alpakka repository.
