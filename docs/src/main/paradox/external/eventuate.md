# Eventuate

This adapter provides an Akka Streams interface for **Eventuate Event logs**. It allows applications to consume event streams from event logs, write event streams to event logs, build idempotent event stream processing networks and exchange events with other systems that provide a Reactive Streams API.


## External library

This library is not maintained in the Alpakka repository.
