# Azure Event Hubs

Reactive Event Hubs is an Akka Stream library that can be used to read events from [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/), via a reactive stream with asynchronous back pressure. Azure Event Hubs is a service used to scale telemetry ingestion from websites, apps, and any streams of data.

The library can be used both in Java and Scala, providing a fluent DSL for both programming languages, similarly to the approach used by Akka.
